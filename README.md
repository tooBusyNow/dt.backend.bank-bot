## Prerequisites
First of all, make sure you've already completed this steps:
- Installed Python 3.10 from [official source](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/) or packet manager. 
<br> Yep, it's time to upgrade your lovely 3.9 :)</br>


- Installed and configured [Ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) on your system. 
<br>This part is essential by now, cause we are going to run Django server on a local machine, but we can't get updates on it directly from Telegram Webhook. So, we'll use Ngrok as a Proxy between global an local nets; </br>

- Installed pipenv: `pip install pipenv`.
<br>

- Optionally installed `make` on your Windows machine. 
<br> Btw, the easiest way to do that is Chocolatey: `choco install make`  </br>


## Installation

(1) Clone this repo at first:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/tooBusyNow/dt.backend.bank-bot.git
cd ./dt.backend.bank-bot
```
(2) Then create a personal `.env` file:
```bash
cat src/.env.example > src/.env
```

(3) Open `.env` file in `src` directory and change <b>TLG_TOKEN</b> value on your actual Token:
```bash
nano src/.env
```

(4) Activate pipenv shell (If you have errors on this step, then you've probably forgot to install Python 3.10.):
```bash
pipenv shell
```

(5) Now it's time to install dependencies: 
```bash
pipenv install
```

(6) Now you are ready to start! ðŸš€

## Usage

Starting with Docker Compose:
```bash
make docker_run
```

And in order to stop just run:
```bash
make docker_stop
```

After starting the server, you could open your browser and make some requests:<br>
```
localhost:8080/api/me/1077392747/

localhost:8080/api/me/0010101010/

localhost:8080/admin/
```
